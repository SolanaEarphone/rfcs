# RFC 0005: Agent Monetization and Revenue Sharing Model for Solana Earphone

## Abstract

This RFC defines the monetization strategies and revenue sharing model for the Solana Earphone agent ecosystem. It establishes a fair and sustainable economic framework that benefits developers, platform operators, and users while ensuring long-term ecosystem growth.

## Motivation

To build a thriving agent marketplace, we need a well-defined monetization strategy that:
- Incentivizes high-quality agent development
- Ensures fair compensation for developers
- Maintains platform sustainability
- Provides flexible pricing options for users
- Supports various business models

## Technical Design

### 1. Revenue Models

#### 1.1 Pricing Strategies

```typescript
interface PricingStrategy {
  type: PricingType;
  parameters: PricingParameters;
  restrictions?: PricingRestrictions;
  trialOptions?: TrialConfig;
}

enum PricingType {
  ONE_TIME = "one_time",
  SUBSCRIPTION = "subscription",
  USAGE_BASED = "usage_based",
  FREEMIUM = "freemium",
  HYBRID = "hybrid"
}

interface PricingParameters {
  basePrice: number;
  currency: string;
  billingCycle?: BillingCycle;
  usageTiers?: UsageTier[];
  featureTiers?: FeatureTier[];
}

interface UsageTier {
  threshold: number;
  price: number;
  unit: UsageUnit;
}

interface FeatureTier {
  name: string;
  features: string[];
  price: number;
}
```

#### 1.2 Revenue Distribution

```typescript
interface RevenueShare {
  developerShare: number;
  platformShare: number;
  networkFee: number;
  taxRate: number;
}

interface PayoutSchedule {
  frequency: PayoutFrequency;
  minimumAmount: number;
  currency: string;

}

interface RevenueMetrics {
  totalRevenue: number;
  activeSubscriptions: number;
  averageRevenuePerUser: number;
  churnRate: number;
}
```
