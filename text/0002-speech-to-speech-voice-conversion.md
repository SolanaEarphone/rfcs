# RFC 0002: Speech-to-Speech Voice Conversion for Solana Earphone

## Abstract

This RFC proposes a real-time speech-to-speech voice conversion system for the Solana Earphone platform, enabling users to transform their voice into different styles and characters while maintaining natural speech quality and low latency.

## Motivation

Voice personalization and transformation have become increasingly popular in digital communication. By implementing voice conversion capabilities in Solana Earphone, we can provide users with enhanced creative expression and privacy protection options during voice communication.

## Technical Design

### 1. Voice Conversion Pipeline

#### 1.1 Processing Chain

```mermaid

    A[Voice Input] --> B[Feature Extraction]
    B --> C[Voice Analysis]
    C --> D[Style Transfer]
    D --> E[Voice Synthesis]
    E --> F[Audio Output]
```

#### 1.2 Core Components

1. **Feature Extraction**
   - Mel-spectrogram generation
   - Fundamental frequency (F0) extraction
   - Prosody analysis
   - Speaker embedding extraction

2. **Voice Analysis**
   - Speaker characteristics identification
   - Emotion recognition
   - Speech content preservation
   - Acoustic feature mapping

3. **Style Transfer**
   - Voice style encoding
   - Cross-attention transformation
   - Adaptive instance normalization
   - Real-time style mixing

4. **Voice Synthesis**
   - Neural vocoder (HiFi-GAN)
   - High-quality waveform generation
   - Low-latency processing
   - Anti-artifact filtering

#### 1.3 Voice Conversion Protocol

```typescript
interface VoiceConversionConfig {
  sourceVoice: VoiceCharacteristics;
  targetStyle: VoiceStyle;
  conversionStrength: number;
  preserveFeatures: PreserveConfig;
}

interface VoiceCharacteristics {
  pitch: number;
  timbre: TimbreFeatures;
  speakingRate: number;
  emotionalTone: EmotionVector;
}

interface VoiceStyle {
  styleId: string;
  parameters: StyleParameters;
  mixingWeights: number[];
  constraints: StyleConstraints;
}

interface ConversionResult {
  audioBuffer: ArrayBuffer;
  quality: QualityMetrics;
  latency: LatencyMetrics;
  styleMatch: number;
}
```

### 2. Style Management System

#### 2.1 Style Library

```typescript
interface StyleLibrary {
  styles: VoiceStyle[];
  categories: StyleCategory[];
  presets: StylePreset[];
  customStyles: CustomStyle[];
}

interface StyleCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  styles: string[]; // Style IDs
}

interface StylePreset {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  baseStyle: string;
  modifications: StyleModification[];
}
```

#### 2.2 Real-time Processing

```typescript
class VoiceProcessor {
  async processFrame(frame: AudioFrame): Promise<ProcessedFrame> {
    const features = await this.extractFeatures(frame);
    const converted = await this.applyStyle(features);
    return this.synthesize(converted);
  }

  private async extractFeatures(frame: AudioFrame): Promise<VoiceFeatures> {
    // Feature extraction implementation
  }

  private async applyStyle(features: VoiceFeatures): Promise<StyledFeatures> {
    // Style transfer implementation
  }
}
```

## Performance Requirements

1. **Latency**
   - End-to-end processing: < 50ms
   - Feature extraction: < 10ms
   - Style transfer: < 20ms
   - Voice synthesis: < 20ms

2. **Quality**
   - Audio quality: > 4.0 MOS
   - Style similarity: > 90%
   - Content preservation: > 95%
   - Artifact-free output

3. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory: < 150MB
   - CPU: < 40% single core
   - GPU: Optional acceleration
   - Battery impact: < 5% additional drain

## Security and Privacy

1. **Voice Data Protection**
   - Local processing priority
   - Encrypted style transfer
   - Anonymous voice conversion
   - Anti-spoofing protection

2. **Style Rights Management**
   - Licensed style verification
   - Usage tracking and limits
   - Style ownership protection

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core System**
   - Basic voice conversion pipeline
   - Essential style library
   - Performance optimization

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
   - Custom style creation
   - Multi-style mixing
   - Advanced voice effects

3. **Phase 3: Ecosystem**
   - Style marketplace
   - Community contributions
   - API integration

## Future Work

1. **Short Term**
   - Implement baseline conversion system
   - Optimize latency and quality
   - Deploy basic style library

2. **Long Term**
   - Advanced emotion transfer
   - Real-time style creation
   - Cross-language support
