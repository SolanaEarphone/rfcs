# Solana Earphone AI-agent RFCs

This repository contains Request for Comments (RFC) documents for the Solana Earphone AI-agent platform. These RFCs are used to propose and discuss substantial changes to the platform's architecture, features, and ecosystem.

## What is Solana Earphone AI-agent?

Solana Earphone AI-agent is an open-source platform that leverages Large Language Models (LLM) for voice-first interactions. It integrates tightly with Solana Earphone hardware to provide developers with a comprehensive environment for building, deploying, and managing voice-interactive AI agents.

## RFC Process

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements, can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow. However, substantial changes require a more structured design process to ensure consensus within the community.
